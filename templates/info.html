    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast start to grow uncontrollably. While breast cancer can affect both men and women, it is far more prevalent in women.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Causes of Breast Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      The exact causes of breast cancer are not fully understood, but several risk factors have been identified. These include genetic factors, hormonal factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. Women with a family history of breast cancer, genetic mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA2, early menstruation, and late menopause are at higher risk.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Precautions and Early Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Taking precautions and early detection are vital in the fight against breast cancer. Women should perform regular self-examinations to check for any unusual lumps or changes in their breasts. Mammograms and clinical breast exams are recommended for early detection. It's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, to reduce the risk.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Treatment and Cure</h3>
    <p>
      Breast cancer is treatable, especially if detected in its early stages. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The specific treatment plan depends on the type and stage of breast cancer. With advancements in medical science, the prognosis for breast cancer has improved significantly in recent years, and many women can make a full recovery.
